	<h2>SurveyGizmo</h2>
	<div style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">
		This plugin version currently communicates only with the SurveyGizmo web application environment (<a href="http://surveygizmo.com" target="_new">http://SurveyGizmo.com</a>) but additional environments are planned for the future.  After credentials have been established,
		this page allows you to select any specially prepared Opinionnaire&reg; Survey (a survey style with specific back end requirements) you have for analysis and Fast Forum&reg; reporting.
	</div>
	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
	<h2>Survey Credentials</h2>
	<div style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">
		This is where you provide the login and password information necessary to connect to your preferred web application survey environment over the Internet.
	</div>
	<h2>Sample Data</h2>
	<div style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">
		Even without an account with a web application survey environment you can still experiment with this plugin using a sample dataset we have provided for you.  The dataset is composed of Demographics (Demo) and Value Statements (VS). A Fast Forum&reg; report must compare at least
		one element from each type.  More help and information will be provided soon.
