== Description ==

Opinionnaire&reg; Survey analysis and Fast Forum&reg; reports is a plugin that calculates an innovative survey metric known as the "Polarization-Consensus Rating" (PC-Rating&#8482;), originally created by Richard J. Spady in the 1970s and now adapted for WordPress by his son John I. Spady.

A tool that imports specialized Opinionnaire&reg;-styled surveys from SurveyGizmo.com to produce a proprietary Fast Forum&reg; report showing Polarization-Consensus Rating (PC-Rating&#8482; cross tabs and graphics and a visualization of the overall Participatory Resistance&#8482; to your survey questions.
